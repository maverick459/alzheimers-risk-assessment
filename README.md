# Alzheimer's Risk Assessment Web Application

A comprehensive Flask-based web application for evaluating Alzheimer's disease risk through patient assessment questionnaires. The application collects demographic, lifestyle, and medical history data to calculate a personalized risk score with detailed recommendations.

## Features

  - Demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, education)
  - Lifestyle factors (BMI, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, diet, sleep)
  - Medical history (family history, chronic conditions)

- **Risk Calculation**: Evidence-based algorithm that calculates:
  - Overall risk score (0-100)
  - Risk level (Low/Moderate/High)
  - Estimated risk percentage
  - Detailed factor breakdown

- **Results Visualization**: 
  - Interactive charts showing risk factor contributions
  - Personalized recommendations
  - Cognitive health tips
  - Risk factor analysis

- **User Experience**:
  - Mobile-responsive design
  - Form data persistence during assessment
  - Progressive form validation
  - Professional medical interface

- **Export Functionality**: Download assessment summary as text file

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-Session
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Visualization**: Chart.js
- **Styling**: Bootstrap with Replit dark theme
- **Icons**: Font Awesome

## Assessment Categories

### Demographics
- Age (60-90 years)
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Ethnicity (Caucasian/African American/Asian/Other)
- Education Level (None/High School/Bachelor's/Higher)

### Lifestyle Factors
- BMI (15-40)
- Smoking Status (Yes/No)
- Weekly Alcohol Consumption (0-20 units)
- Weekly Physical Activity (0-10 hours)
- Diet Quality Score (0-10)
- Sleep Quality Score (4-10)

### Medical History
- Family History of Alzheimer's

## Risk Calculation Algorithm

The application uses a weighted scoring system based on medical research:

- **Age**: 25% weight - Risk increases exponentially after 65
- **Medical History**: 30% weight - Family history and chronic conditions
- **Lifestyle**: 20% weight - BMI, smoking, exercise, diet, sleep
- **Education**: 12% weight - Higher education is protective
- **Gender**: 8% weight - Women have slightly higher risk
- **Ethnicity**: 5% weight - Varies by ethnic group

**Risk Levels:**
- Low: 0-29 points
- Moderate: 30-59 points  
- High: 60-100 points

## Usage Tips

1. **Complete Assessment**: Fill out all three sections for accurate results
2. **Honest Responses**: Provide accurate information for meaningful results
3. **Save Progress**: The form automatically saves your progress as you go
4. **Export Results**: Download your assessment summary for your records
5. **Consult Healthcare Provider**: Share results with your doctor for professional guidance

## Security Features

- Form validation on client and server side
- CSRF protection
- Secure session management
- No personal data persistence

## Browser Support

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application won't start**:
   - Check Python version (3.7+ required)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Set SESSION_SECRET environment variable

2. **Form data not saving**:
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify session directory permissions

3. **Charts not displaying**:
   - Check internet connection (Chart.js loads from CDN)
   - Verify browser JavaScript support
   - Clear browser cache

### Performance Optimization

- Use Redis for session storage in production
- Enable gzip compression
- Implement caching for static assets
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx) for production deployment
